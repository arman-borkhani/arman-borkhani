### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Front-end web developer with 3 years of experience in developing responsive web applications, Iâ€™m proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have experience working with the Vue.js framework.

Making CSS drawings and sharing them on my [CodePen account](https://codepen.io/armanb) is a great pleasure for me. Recently I have created a project called [Single DIV](https://github.com/arman-borkhani/single-div) and I am trying to make CSS drawings with just a single div element
